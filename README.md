### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zsolt, I'm an Engineering Manager specializing in backend systems (mainly written in ruby) as well as platform engineering (or DevOps as some others call it). In my free time I love doing weird mapping related projects as well as some stupid mini-games. You can find all of them in [my portfolio page](https://sztupy.hu/projects/)

Some of my highlights:

* [National Blue Trail section lookup tool](https://sztupy.hu/kekkor-kereso/)
* [Primary and Secondary school performance map of Scotland](https://sztupy.hu/scotland-school-map/)
* [Hungarian emigration map based on election statistics](https://sztupy.hu/honnanjottel/)
* [2048 Hard Edition](https://sztupy.hu/2048-Hard)
* [Magic Lantern port for Canon 60D](https://bitbucket.org/sztupy/magic-lantern-for-60d)
* [Lua 5.1 decompiler](https://github.com/sztupy/luadec51)
* [USB host mode driver for Samsung phones](https://github.com/sztupy/samsung-kernel-aries)
